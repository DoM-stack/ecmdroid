EcmDroid
--------

EcmDroid is an Android application to diagnose and configure Buell
Motorcycles with a DDFI(-2, -3) ECM. Communiation with the ECM is
achieved through a Bluetooth serial adapter connected to the motorcycles
diagnostic plug (located underneath the seat). EcmDroid requires the
android device to provide external storage (e.g. through an sd card)
for saving and loading EEPROM data or recording a diagnostic log. These
files are located at /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/org.ecmdroid/files. EEPROM
data must be placed in a subdirectory named 'eeprom' and must end with
'.xpr'. Log files will be stored in subdirectory 'log'.

Initial pairing of your android device and the bluetooth serial adapter
must be done using the Android Settings application (Wireless & Network).
Also, make sure that BT serial adapter is set to  9600, 8N1, No Handshake.
